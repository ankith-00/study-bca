        <ul>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Start/ End              </li> <p class="def">Algorithms begin with a "start" symbol and end with an "end" symbol, indicating the beginning and conclusion of the algorithm.    </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Pseudocode              </li> <p class="def">A simplified programming language that combines elements of natural language and programming syntax. Pseudocode is commonly used to represent algorithms in a way that is easy for humans to understand.  </p>

            <li class="m-h fw-300">Variables               </li> <p class="def">Variables are used to store and manipulate data within the algorithm. They are usually represented with letters or names, such as "x" or "result.” </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Arithmetic Operations   </li> <p class="def">Common mathematical symbols like "+," "-", "*", and "/" are used to represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, respectively.  </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Conditional Statements  </li> <p class="def">Conditional statements like "if," "else if," and "else" are used to create branches in the algorithm based on certain conditions. These statements help in decision-making within the algorithm.   </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Loops                   </li> <p class="def">Loops are used for repetitive tasks. Common loop structures include "for," "while," and "do-while" loops. </p>

        <br> <br>  <br>

        <p class="m-h fs-12">STEPS FOR ANALYSING & SOLVING PROBLEM</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Analyzing the Problem       </li> <p class="def">To clearly understand a problem before we begin to find the solution for it. If we are not clear as to what is to be solved, we may end up developing a program which may not solve our purpose. Thus, we need to read and analyze the problem statement carefully in order to list the principal components of the problem and decide the core functionalities that our solution should have.     </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Designing Algorithm         </li> <p class="def">The design of an algorithm depends mainly on the problem and chosen design technique. There can be more than one algorithm to solve the same problem, and the choice between them will be decided by their effectiveness.  </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Analysis of Algorithm       </li> <p class="def">An algorithm analysis is a technique that's used to measure the performance of the algorithms. Speed is one of the key parameters in determining the potential of an algorithm. There are some other factors, like user-friendliness, security, maintainability, and usage space, that determine the quality of an algorithm. Space and time complexity are metrics used to measure parameters.    </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Implementation or Coding    </li> <p class="def">After finalizing the algorithm, we need to convert the algorithm into the Format which can be understood by the computer to generate the desired solution. Different programming languages can be used for writing a program. We must convert each Step of the algorithm into one or more statements in a programming language such as C, C++, and Java etc.   </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Testing and Debugging       </li> <p class="def">The program created should be tested on various parameters. The program should meet the requirements of the user. It must respond within the expected time. It should generate correct output for all possible inputs. Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting or removing the Bugs (errors).   </p>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>  <br>

        <p class="m-h fs-12">CHARACTERISTICS OF ALGORITHM</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Well-described steps        </li> <p class="def">Algorithms are composed of a specific and unambiguous set of instructions or steps that can be observed to perform a selected task or solve a problem. Each step ought to be well-defined, leaving no room for ambiguity or confusion. </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Input and output            </li> <p class="def">Algorithms take inputs, which might be the preliminary records or facts furnished to the algorithm, and produce outputs, which are the results or solutions generated by using the set of rules after processing the inputs. The relation among the inputs and outputs is decided by means of the algorithm's good judgment.   </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Finitenes                   </li> <p class="def">Algorithms must have a well-defined termination condition. This method means that they finally attain an endpoint or change after a finite quantity of steps. If a set of rules runs indefinitely without termination, it's far taken into consideration wrong or incomplete.  </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Determinism                 </li> <p class="def">Algorithms are deterministic, that means that given the same inputs and achieved below the same conditions, they may continually produce the identical outputs. The conduct of a set of rules ought to be predictable and regular.     </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Efficiency                  </li> <p class="def">Algorithms attempt to be efficient in phrases of time and sources. They goal to clear up issues or perform obligations in an inexpensive quantity of time and with ultimate use of computational sources like memory, processing power, or garage. </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Correctness                 </li> <p class="def">Algorithms must be designed to produce correct results for all legitimate inputs inside their domain. They must accurately solve the problem they may be designed for, and their outputs must match the anticipated consequences.  </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Modularity and reusability  </li> <p class="def">Algorithms may be modular, meaning they may be divided into smaller subproblems or features that may be reused in unique parts of the algorithm or in other algorithms. This promotes code agency, maintainability, and code reuse.   </p>
            <li class="m-h fw-300">Understandability           </li> <p class="def">Algorithms need to be designed with clarity and ease in mind, making them easy to apprehend and implement. Well-documented and readable code can enhance the understandability of an algorithm.    </p>
        </ul>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><p class="def">This notation is known as the upper bound of the algorithm, or a Worst Case of an algorithm. It tells us that a certain function will never exceed a specified time for any value of input n. <br> <br>Big Oh notation gives an upper bound on function f(n). The upper bound of f(n) indicates that the function f(n) will be the worst-case that it does not consume more than this computing time.</p></div> <br>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><p class="def">The theta notation can be used when the function f(n) can be bounded both from above and below by the same function g(n). For some functions, the lower bound and upper bound may be the same. In finding the maximum or minimum element in an array, the computing time is 0(n) and 2(n). </p></div>
